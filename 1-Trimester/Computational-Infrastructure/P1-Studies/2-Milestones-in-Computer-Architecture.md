# 2 - Milestones in Computer Architecture

## The Zeroth Generation - Mechanical Computers (1642-1945)

- Blaise Pascal built in 1642 a mechanical device that could do addition and subtraction operations.
- Baron Gotfried Leibniz built a mechanical machine that could multiply and divide as well (like a four-function pocket calculator)
- Charles Babbage designed the device difference engine to compute tables of numbers useful for naval navigation
- Charles Babage desinged the **analytical engine**. This device had four components: The store(memory), the mill (computation unit), the input section (punched-card reader) and the output section (punched and printed output)
