# Agile e Software Process

- "Metodologias e métodos vão suportar os processos"
- The Agile methods stress two concepts (Highsmith & Cockburn, 2001): 
	1. The unforgiving honesty of working code 
	2. The effectiveness of people working together with goodwill

<br>

- Agile Manifesto  
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
	- Responding to change over following a plan

<br>

- A dominant idea in **agile development** is that the team can be more effective in **responding to change** if it can
	- reduce the cost of moving information between people, and 
	- reduce the elapsed time between making a decision to seeing the consequences of that decision.

<br>

- To **reduce the cost of moving information between people**, the agile team works to
	- place people physically closer,
	- replace documents with talking in person and at whiteboards, and
	- improve the team's amicability - its sense of community and morale - so that people are more inclined to relay valuable information quickly

<br>

- To reduce the **time from decision to feedback**, the **agile team**
	- Makes user experts available to the team or, even better, part of the team and 
	- works incrementally
